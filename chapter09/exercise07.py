'''â€œConsider the following statement, which creates a list of populations of countries in eastern Asia (China, DPR Korea, Hong Kong, Mongolia, Republic of Korea, and Taiwan) in millions: country_populations = [1295, 23, 7, 3, 47, 21]. Write a for loop that adds up all the values and stores them in variable total. (Hint: Give total an initial value of zero, and, inside the loop body, add the population of the current country to total.)'''

country_populations = [1295,23,7,3,47,21]
total = 0
for i in country_populations:
    total += i
